AI Usage Documentation
Purpose of Using AI

AI was used in this project to simulate an astrology expert who generates personalized, structured, and readable predictions based on user-provided birth details. The goal is to demonstrate ethical, transparent, and guided use of AI, not to replace human judgment.

AI Tools Used

Cursor AI
Used during frontend development for:

Writing and refining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code

Improving form validation and UI structure

Debugging layout and client-side logic

Large Language Model (LLM) via n8n
Used in the backend workflow to:

Act as an AI astrologer

Generate astrology-based predictions from structured user input

How AI Is Integrated

User submits astrological details through the frontend form.

The form sends validated data to an n8n webhook.

n8n passes the structured data to an LLM node with a carefully designed prompt.

The AI generates predictions in a controlled, non-absolute format.

Predictions are emailed to the user via n8n.

Prompt Design & Control

The prompt instructs the AI to:

Avoid extreme, harmful, or deterministic statements

Use neutral, guidance-based language

Structure output under clear headings (Career, Health, Relationships, etc.)

Include a disclaimer stating predictions are for guidance only

Input data is clearly labeled to reduce ambiguity and hallucinations.

Human Oversight & Responsibility

AI outputs are not treated as factual or medical advice.

Predictions are framed as general guidance, not guaranteed outcomes.

The system includes a disclaimer emphasizing that astrology predictions are informational only.

The project demonstrates human control over prompt design, workflow logic, and output usage.

Ethical & Responsible AI Practices

No sensitive or unnecessary personal data is collected.

User data is used only for generating predictions and sending emails.

AI decisions are transparent through documented prompts and workflows.

Users are informed that predictions are AI-generated.

Limitations & Assumptions

Predictions are generalized and not scientifically verified.

Accuracy depends entirely on user-provided input.

The AI does not replace professional astrologers or expert advice.

Time of birth and gender are treated as optional inputs.
